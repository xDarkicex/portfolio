                    <p>This project all kinda started one day when searching for an answer on how to do something in JavaScript and found myself in the depths of <a href='http://stackoverflow.com' target='_blank'>Stack Overflow</a>, receiving rather uncharitable responses from other users, proclaiming my question as "off-topic" or "too vague", and often received responses like, "well, this is how you can do it in <em>this</em> language instead". There's a reason I asked my question in JavaScript. This experience had actually led me to an understanding that writing web apps and sites was simply not easy due to the sole lack of resources; finding that, should I need a good resource, I would have to fork out a couple hundred bucks to buy a book by a rather biased author. Which I simply didn't like.</p>
                    <p>Technology is evolving, and it's going very quickly, at an exponential rate. I feel that, in a way, technology should be something for a community. Not for the rich and all-knowing. It also brought on an understanding that it makes people intimidated, and I should be everything but intimidating. I started this project to offer priceless resources for any aspiring programmer or web developer, and offering solutions for real-world applications. Yes, I want this project to be 100% <em>free</em>.</p>
                    <p>With the rapid growth and development of new programming languages and new standards, I feel everyone should at least, to some degree, have some idea of the $1000 phone they just bought, or the $2000 laptop that will most likely sit there and collect dust aside from the occasional let-me-check-my-email-really-quick. Again, technology shouldn't be intimidating. It's actually really fun and quick and painless. Just make sure you're going to the right place. <em>This</em> is that right place. Take a tour and you'll soon find that it's as simple as integrating muscle memory to never leave your house without your phone.</p>

                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>As I mentioned earlier, I believe everyone should have some understanding of the items they use and purchase. It all starts with the current generation. Right here, in Fresno, we plan to coordinate with the three school districts to offer intros to computer science as early on as Sophomore year in high school. By then, most students should be enrolled in a decent math course that we can use to further their expertise. Each student that enrolls, we hold progress trackers. These courses will be offered for all science degree programs, as the current programs will be kept in place. This means nothing changes for the current professor who was hired for that class. For students who show gumption and creativity and learn at an effective rate, we want to reach back out to you as a way of saying thanks, where we can offer you a full-time, or part-time job of your choosing. For students who go all the way with all courses endorsed by nVision, you are also welcome, and we want to work with you as well. Even for people who have little-to-no experience whatsoever in programming. Should you need a job, period, we want to help. I want to help. It starts as being an unpaid intern, we will teach you everything to our standards. Should you show improvement, we'll bring you on as a paid intern. The more experienced you get, we will eventually bring you onto client projects, where you can choose whether to be part-time or full-time. Again, of your liking.</p>
                    <p>Fresno has the fifth largest population in California, which is the agriculture resource center of America. And it's time we treat it that way. Although nVision works to be a profit organization, not only will we be providing jobs for hundreds and thousands of people, we will be pushing to better education for computer science and web design courses. These services by nVision will all be offered for free. Donations and outside funding will be welcomed, and, with the funding we receive, we will be serving massive amounts into the production of agriculture, putting jobs back in the central valley, as well as bring water back to the central valley. We all know what we need to do, but who's going to do it?</p>
